**Objectives:**
- String manipulations
- User input validation

**Requirements:**
- Inputs for User first and last name
- Check if the string is great than >20 characters and give a warning – but do not continue the program if invalid
- Inputs for User badge number
- Check if badge number is valid and 3 digits– but do not continue the program if invalid
- Have at least 1 creative element – images, fonts, background color, etc. 
- Create a nice look and feel for the user and make a great user experience!
- Comment above almost every line of your code, both HTML and JavaScript!
- Put a comment at the top of your HTML file with your name in it.
- Take one or more screen prints of your application running.

PRO TIPS:
- Put all input boxes and buttons inside the one form tag.
- On the form, you should have all your input boxes, but only one submit button so the user will submit all the input boxes all at once. Your JavaScript should start validating them all at once when the user presses submit.
